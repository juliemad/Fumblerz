## **What is Fumblerz?**
This is a mini series that will follow the main characters and their different silly stories on how they fumbled! Watch as these characters explore their new curiosity towards love through their own various experiences.

As this is a fairly new concept I decided to play around with, there isn't much I have to show of it right now but I have a few characters and a few stories in my head that are bubbling! These may change a lot over the course of this semester!

I orginally came up with this idea as to recreate funny storytimes that me and my friends have experienced and wanted to share as silly little inside jokes!
